# IT Support Tools and Utilities

I created [jamieclay.com](https://jamieclay.com) for quick access to useful tools when I'm working on a Windows client. It's a collection of software, PowerShell and batch command lines and scripts, and anything else that speeds up configuration, maintenance and troubleshooting.

For downloads like software and PowerShell modules, you'll find a link to the official download page and another for the documentation. Commands and small scripts are in the listing itself. Click the clipboard, paste and go. They also have a link to relevant documentation.

There are search and filter functions for when the collection grows bigger. 

## Examples
- Nirsoft utilities for troubleshooting.
- Command line snippets for diagnostics and troubleshooting.
- A Windows installation, debloat and tweak script from Chris Titus.

Humans are for creating order from chaos. Computers are for repetition. The faster I can get off that client and back to my automations, the better.
